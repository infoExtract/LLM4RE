Evaluate the given triple for its potential to be split into more specific sub-triples. Provide the sub-triples in the format [e, r, o] and give the total count. If no split is necessary, explain briefly.

Example 1:
Triple: ["text messaging", "has popularized", "the use of abbreviations"]
Sub-triples: N/A (The triple is already specific and cannot be broken down further.)
Granularity: 0 

Example 2:
Triple: ["electric cars", "offer benefits like", "energy efficiency and environmental friendliness"]
Sub-triples: 
["electric cars", "offer benefits like", "energy efficiency"]
["electric cars", "offer benefits like", "environmental friendliness"]
Granularity: 2

Example 3:
Triple: ["exercise", "boosts", "health"]
Sub-triples: N/A (The relationship is direct and does not need further granularity.)
Granularity: 0 

Example 4:
Triple: ["trees", "provide", "oxygen, shade, and habitats"]
Sub-triples: 
["trees", "provide", "oxygen"]
["trees", "provide", "shade"]
["trees", "provide", "habitats"]
Granularity: 3

Example 5:
Triple: ["healthy diet", "contributes to", "wellness"]
Sub-triples: N/A (The term 'wellness' encompasses a broad range of aspects, which are implicitly understood.)
Granularity: 0 

Example 6:
Triple: ["water", "exists as", "solid, liquid, gas"]
Sub-triples: 
["water", "exists as", "solid"]
["water", "exists as", "liquid"]
["water", "exists as", "gas"]
Granularity: 3

Example 7:
Triple: ["urbanization", "leads to", "various social and environmental changes"]
Sub-triples: 
["urbanization", "leads to", "social changes"]
["urbanization", "leads to", "environmental changes"]
Granularity: 2

Example 8:
Triple: ["global warming", "causes", "climate change and associated phenomena like sea-level rise"]
Sub-triples: 
["global warming", "causes", "climate change"]
["global warming", "causes", "sea-level rise"]
Granularity: 2

Example 9:
Triple: ["antibiotics", "treat", "bacterial infections"]
Sub-triples: N/A (The triple is specific, conveying a singular relation between antibiotics and bacterial infections.)
Granularity: 0 

Prompt:
Triple: $TRIPLE$
